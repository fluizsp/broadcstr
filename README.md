# Welcome to Broadcstr!
## What is Broadcstr?

Broadcstr is the social media that you control and define the boundaries.

It is built using **Nostr**: A simple, open protocol that enables a truly censorship-resistant and global social network.  

## Why Broadcstr?

Because it is like your social network, but:  

- **Private**: Your account doesn't require e-mails or phone numbers. Start just with your pair of keys;

- **Value4Value**: Reward your favorite content with Bitcoin Lightning Network! Tip and stack sats;

### Stack
Broadcstr was built using React.js and Chakra-ui.

Since it's the first release, the code is still messy and needing a ton of refactor and improvements, I will soon update this section also.

### Available Scripts

  

In the project directory, you can run:

  

#### `npm start`

  

Runs the app in production/optimized mode, using the app on the build folder.<br  />

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

  

The page will reload if you make edits.<br  />

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

  

#### `npm run dev`

  

Runs the app in the development mode.<br  />

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

  

The page will reload if you make edits.<br  />

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

  

#### `npm test`

  

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br  />

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

  

#### `npm run build`

  

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br  />

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br  />

Your app is ready to be deployed!

  

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

  

### `npm run eject`

  

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

  

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

  

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

  

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
